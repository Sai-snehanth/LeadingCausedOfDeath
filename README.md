Health Data Analysis and Visualization Project

Welcome to the Health Data Analysis and Visualization project! This repository documents the end-to-end process of collecting, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing health-related datasets sourced from the World Health Organization (WHO), Kaggle, and other online datasets. The final product is an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides insights into the health data.

Project Overview

This project demonstrates the following steps:

Data Collection: Sourced datasets from:

1) WHO (World Health Organization)

2)Kaggle

3)Google Dataset Search

Data Cleaning and Processing:

1.Utilized Python with the Pandas library to clean and preprocess raw datasets.

2.Performed additional cleaning and visualization in Excel for specific files.

3.Used SQL to clean and organize another dataset.

Data Integration:

* Combined datasets from multiple sources: Excel, Python, and MySQL Server.

Visualization:

1: Built interactive dashboards in Power BI to present the analyzed data.

Tools and Technologies Used

A) Python (Pandas for data cleaning and processing)

B) Excel (for additional data cleaning and dashboarding)

C) SQL (for structured data cleaning and queries)

D) Power BI (for data visualization and dashboard creation)
